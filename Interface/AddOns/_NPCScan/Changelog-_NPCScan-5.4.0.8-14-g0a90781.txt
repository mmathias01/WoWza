SLOKnightfall:
	- Fixed _g.InCombatLockdown error
James D. Callahan III:
	- Ticket #27: Hide target_button upon creation - at this point no scripts are required.
	- Moved more things around.
	- Moved more target_button settings.
	- Renamed NS to target_button and moved most of its relevant settings to immediately after its creation.
	- Useless line is useless.
	- Store completion state of an achievement on the achievement object.
	- Removed AchievementCritertaUpdate() by stuffing its body into private.Updater.OnLoop() which was the only place it was ever used.
	- Comment cleanup.
	- Scoping fix.
	- Reformatting.
	- Variable renames.
	- Logic flip.
	- Do away with private.SlashCommand() - simply assign the function to the SlashCmdList entry directly.
