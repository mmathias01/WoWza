BugGrabber will now re-enable itself after hitting the 10 messages/sec limit and not stay disabled indefinitely.... and if that wasn't the purpose, back out the changes and I'll know to switch to (and recommend) something else.
 
I also changed the mechanic from OnUpdate-based clamping (which actually lets 8324983745345 messages through during the first second) to clamping in the error grabber - which also has the benefit of spending CPU only when it needs to be spent (when something is erroring).

Attempt to fix a script too long error by not bothering to sanitize the locals dump. If it's the locals dump function itself taking too long this won't fix anything and we may just need to remove the listing of locals.
