HALOPRO's CUSTOM TEXTURES

If you wish to use your own custom textures for HaloPro notifications, simply place the texture files in this folder, overwriting the existing files and select "Custom"
in HaloPro's options under theme.

You must have 6 texture files and they must be named the following in a .tga format

center.tga
left.tga
mid_left.tga
mid_right.tga
offcd.tga
right.tga

The file names should be self explanitory as to which texture corresponds to which action of HaloPro.

The textures resolution must have power-of-two dimensions up to 1024 pixels. The TGA images may have 
8, 24, or 32 bits per pixel for grayscale, RGB, and RGBA images respectively; RLE is supported. If you go 
outside of this the image will only show as a bright green bar and not your texture.

The textures that come with HaloPro are 256 and that seems to give a sharp image that scales well without being too memory and system taxing.

If you wish to have your textures included as a default option in future releases of HaloPro, please feel free to contact me with a pm at
