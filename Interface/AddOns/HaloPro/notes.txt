HaloPro v2.0 is ready for release.

New features

Borders
- Borders can match ElvUI and other dark UI's perfectly
- Added borders to the graphic making it look a lot nicer
- Border options can be found on the theme panel in options
- Borders can have a glow effect, thin line, or solid look
- Borders thickness can be scaled up or down and work with custom graphics
- Borders can have their colour adjusted with a colour wheel
- Borders have a dark and light theme to choose from (auto selects light when choosing colours as they will not show on dark themes)

Additional Talents
- HaloPro now has the option to monitor Divine Star and Cascade in addition to Halo
- Each spell can be turned on and off with toggle buttons in the main options panel

Divine Star
- Shows in the middle (green), up to 30 yards
- Shows far yellow at 30-35 yards
- Shows red for 35+ yards

So green will always hit twice, yellow will almost always hit twice if careful, red may hit, but probably once only if at all.
Due to the very short cooldown of Divine Star, fading out on cast is auto disabled as it's too quick to be useful (that's what she said?)
Sound notification is also disabled when using Divine Star as it is essentially, just an "in range" check

Cascade
- Shows left red at 0-30 yards
- Shows left yellow at 30-35 yards
- Shows centre green at 35-40 yards
- Shows right yellow at 40-45 yards
- Shows right red at 45+ yards

So it will always be in range and do the best damage or heal in green.  Far yellow you will not be able to cast, so position in green and always get a max return on Cascade.

Notifications
- Splashes a notification when changing talents to let you know what HaloPro is now monitoring

Menus
- Fixed up the meus slightly and added a backdrop priest image in the options panel when HaloPro is locked as it was too empty and plain

Bugfixes
- Fixed an issue that could cause HaloPro to not work even when listed in the addons button on login
- Fixed an issue that could happen when casting shadowfiend or mindbender causing CompactRaidFrame.lua errors
- Fixed an issue that could cause the border animation of auto cast pet spells like shadowcrawl to appear as a white dot
- Further optimized memory usage and set a garbage collection when locking HaloPro
