Changed paths:
   A /tags/3.03.32 (from /trunk:414)

*3.03.32 (19-NOV-2013)*
 * fixed - some techniques were showing as unuseable because their tooltips were formatted differently to patterns and recipes
 * changed - tooltip item counts should use less cpu (less impact on framerate)
 * fixed - removed the blue glow from the bar numbers in edit mode
 * changed - (via keybinding only) druid bear/cat/travel/moonkin forms are now cancelled before attempting to mount (aquatic and flight forms are never cancelled as they are usually faster or same speed)
 * changed - (via keybinding only) shaman and warlock non humanoid forms are now cancelled before attempting to mount
 * fixed - timeless items (the "unopened" versions) are now be under the same category as the "opened" versions - equipable items (bind to account)
