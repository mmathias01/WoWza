	- tandanu via svn r10724: what? that line made no sense.
	- Omega via svn r10723: Remove whirling yell, it's not useful to anyone Revert change done to fix timers since it appears sometimes, the inactive boss can be boss3, not obss4. Have to find another way to work around crap activation detection. Fix mutate CD

	- Omega via svn r10707: Remove useless warning
	- Omega via svn r10706: Fix one bug i could see in paragons calculated check. Although I know there has to be another problem since NONE of it works right now from what I can see. the code is utter shit since blizz is 0 compromise on this and hides stuff from CLEU...This is very hard to test though so I may just remove all of it

James D. Callahan III:
	- Attempt at fixing .pkgmeta issue.
subversion:
	- nbluewiz via svn r10689: # Brawlers : Fix match ends when mage's mirror image died. # Add rank 9 warning and fix bug.
	- nbluewiz via svn r10688: # Core : Add IsSpellCaster().
	- Omega via svn r10687: Too many users simply don't realize how to customize sound options to get most out of mod, so doing following: 1. Make advanced special warning sound options on by default 2. Embed LSM
	- Omega via svn r10686: Try to fix a bug in paragon start timers not working
	- Omega via svn r10685: Tone down active/fades timers that aren't important. Many bosses have too much timer spam. people lose focus on ability cds when there are like 6 timers on screen. ESPECIALLY if there is a cast bar such as whirling corruption on garrosh, definitely don't need an extra bar that's on by default. if they want it, they can turn it on. Only want it on by default if 1. it's not something that's very obvious (no cast bar) 2. There is almost nothing else going (only couple timers up maybe, not like 5 or 6) 3. It's actually dangerous or important.
	- Omega via svn r10684: Better option defaults.
	- Omega via svn r10683: Prevent scenario wipe when IsInScenarioGroup() returns false while in a scenario (warlock solo scenario) Remove unused flex stuff
	- pkgmeta test
	- tandanu via svn r10682: increment alpha version number
